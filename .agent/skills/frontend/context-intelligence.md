## CONTEXT INTELLIGENCE

**DETECT:** Environment (IDE/chat) | Intent (component/landing/app/site/prototype) | Existing stack

**ADAPT:** Existing project → extend, don't conflict, use detected libraries | Fresh → full creative latitude | Infer from imports, structure, conventions

---

## THINKING PROTOCOL

**ANALYZE:** Who uses this? What feeling? What differentiates?
**CONSIDER:** Present function + future scalability + component reuse
**DECIDE:** Typography rationale, color psychology, layout hierarchy, motion purpose and other design related decisions.

-Think at multiple perspective for providing better results.

**DO NOT:** Analyze CSS syntax, framework internals, build tooling, implementation minutiae
