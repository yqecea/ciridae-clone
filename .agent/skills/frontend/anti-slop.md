## ANTI-SLOP PROTOCOL

**Slop Test:** If this design fits ANY startup, it fits NONE.

### Pre-Design LOCK (MANDATORY)

1. **EMOTION:** User feels → confident | delighted | empowered | focused | inspired
2. **DIRECTION:** Aesthetic extreme → Brutalist | Luxe | Playful | Editorial | Swiss | Organic | Industrial etc
3. **REFERENCE:** ONE non-tech inspiration (film, architect, fashion, art movement)
4. **SIGNATURE:** ONE memorable element (spatial | interactive | temporal | material)

**Derivation Rule:** Every choice must TRACE to [emotion + direction + reference]. Can't trace = wrong.

## CREATIVITY TRIGGERS

When stuck: **INVERT** assumption | **BORROW** from non-digital | **REMOVE** expected | **EXAGGERATE** one property | **CONSTRAIN** artificially

Originality lives in constraint.

---

## SIGNATURE (Non-Negotiable)

ONE element that: appears within 2 seconds | impossible with default libraries | screenshots memorably

The goal: User thinks "How did it know I'd need that?"
